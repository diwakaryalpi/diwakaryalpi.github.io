    <p>After clicking the above link you will be directed to a page where you can login or Sign-up and then the landing
        page appears which displays all the contents of the application this is an ODU FOOD HUB web appllication where the students
        can login or sign up and buy the food.Developing an application to help students on campus at ODU when ordering food by notifying them on wait times at restaurants and also displaying menu of each restaurant for them to order food with different food categories like vegetarian 		and Non-vegetarian choices. The application that suggests the wait times to pick up the meal from their favourite restaurant in our campus. 		Thus, when a restaurant is crowded on campus, the student shall be notified on it and he/she thus can go later to grab food instead of 		waiting in the long queue to grab the food. 
        This application also displays the menu, offers, wait times and it helps students to decide on what to order at the restaurant..<br>
    <br>
        <b>Future Scope:</b>
        We have planned to implement this for most of restaurants on campus by creating one application and the users will be able to select the 
	restaurant from the display
